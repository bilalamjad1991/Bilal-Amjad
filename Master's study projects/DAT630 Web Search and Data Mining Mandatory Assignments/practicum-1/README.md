# Practicum 1

### Learning objectives

  - Ranking documents using the Vector Space Model
  - Building an inverted index
  - Term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time scoring


### Exercises

  1. **Term weighting and vector space retrieval**: Score a toy-sized document collection against a query using the vector space model (i.e., TFIDF term weighting and cosine similarity).

  2. **Building an inverted index**: Build an inverted index from a collection of 1000 documents, with the term frequencies stored.

  3. **Term-at-a-time scoring**: Implement term-at-a-time scoring using vector space retrieval with TFIDF term weighting.

  4. **Document-at-a-time scoring**: Implement document-at-a-time scoring using vector space retrieval with TFIDF term weighting.
