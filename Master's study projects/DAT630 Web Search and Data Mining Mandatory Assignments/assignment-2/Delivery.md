**Additional comments**: DT kaggle competition: **The team name for the submissions must be the GitHub username of the team leader.**
Mind that if we've spent only the minimum necessary time to find your team among the ones in the mandatory leaderboard -by following the previous statement-, it wouldn't fulfill the minimum accuracy and wouldn't be approved.


Assignment **APPROVED**.
