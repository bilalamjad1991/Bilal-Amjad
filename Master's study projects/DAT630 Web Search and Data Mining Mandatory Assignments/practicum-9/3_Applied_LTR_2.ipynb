    "1. **Apply min-max normalization on the feature values** and see if it changes retrieval performance. Note that you need to use the same folds for cross-validation, in order to make it a fair comparison.\n",

    "    - $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ are the original values for a given feature\n",
    "    - $\\tilde{x}_i$ is the transformed feature value for the $i$th instance\n",
