## Baseline retrieval

Complete the table with baseline retrieval results.

  - For this part, you need to report numbers using the Elasticsearch instance that you access via the API.
  - For the anchor text field, limit results to documents that are present in the "Category B" subset of the collection.

| **Field** | **Output file** | **NDCG@10** | **NDCG@20** |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Title | *TODO* | *TODO* | *TODO* |
| Content | *TODO* | *TODO* | *TODO* |
| Anchors | *TODO* | *TODO* | *TODO* |


List the names of Jupyter notebooks or other code files that were used for producing the results in the above table:
  - *TODO*
  - *TODO*


## Learning-to-Rank

Complete the table with learning-to-rank results.

  - These numbers should be obtained using 5-fold cross-validation on the provided queries and relevance judgments.
  - We distinguish between 3 feature groups:
      - [QD] Query-document features
      - [Q] Query features
      - [D] Document features
  - Report on four combinations of feature groups: QD, QD+Q, QD+D, QD+Q+D
  - Use the same training/test folds to make sure the numbers are comparable!

| **Features** | **Output file** | **NDCG@10** | **NDCG@20** |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Only QD features | *TODO* | *TODO* | *TODO* |
| QD + Q features | *TODO* | *TODO* | *TODO* |
| QD + D features | *TODO* | *TODO* | *TODO* |
| ALL features (QD + Q + D) | *TODO* | *TODO* | *TODO* |


List the features used with a brief explanation:
  - Query-document features [QD] (min. 6)
    1. *TODO*
    2. *TODO*
    3. *TODO*
    4. *TODO*
    5. *TODO*
    6. *TODO*
  - Query features [Q] (min. 2)
    1. *TODO*
    2. *TODO*
  - Document features [D] (min. 2)
    1. *TODO*
    2. *TODO*

List the names of Jupyter notebooks or other code files that were used for producing the results in the above table:
  - *TODO*
