Instructions to run:
You can run the code using xampp server.

How to use:
Enter desired quantity of product to buy, in the quantity textbox and press "Add to Cart" button on the index.php file. Then press "View Cart" button to view your cart products.
Here, you can either delete the product by pressing "Delete" button or Update the quantity of the product by entering desired quantity in the quantity textbox
and then press "Update" button to Update the cart.

Note:
I have build this application for evaluation purpose. So that you can see that I can code. 
I just want to tell you that I was not given fixed or particular requirements regarding the 
design/theme of the front end of the application but I am able to design the layout as per requirement also.
I mean to say that design and elements can be improved also. 

Also, I have used bootstrap for styling of page content which is included as an external css file named as "style.css" 
and for hover effect of social media icons. I have also done internal css (which is my own code) for styling of menu/navigation bar,
search product textbox, social media icons and for sign up textbox for newsletter. So that you can have an idea that I can do both ways. 

I am displaying product's name, image and price as a hardcode value on the cart in the index.php file i.e.
I am not using any kind of database to fetch these items from it. After that, I am using Sessions
to store these details of a product and sending it to viewCart.php file to Update or Delete a product, if needed.
