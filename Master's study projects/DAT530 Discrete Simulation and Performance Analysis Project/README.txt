There is a wide range of fast food restaurants out there in the market nowadays, but I have chosen McDonald’s for my project. In this project, I have simulated all the processes that a McDonald’s customer goes through in relation to buying food for himself. For simulation and evaluation of these processes, I have made use of MATLAB and GPenSIM. As, I have three types of customers involved that’s why I have used the technique of colored petri net for the categorization of the tokens. Whereas, testing and analysis results give us a meaningful insight of sales, production time and various likewise aspects related to the restaurant.
