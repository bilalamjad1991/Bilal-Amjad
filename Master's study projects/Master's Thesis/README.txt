The MATLAB simulation code is attached to the pdf file.
This is my master's thesis which was developed on MATLAB using GPenSIM and Petri Net theory.
Abstract:
Elevators are an important source of transportation in high rise building to take people across different floors in short amount of time. It helps to reduce time and energy of people. My thesis work is all about elevators. As we know, behind the working of any elevator there is an algorithm which is responsible for the movement of car and handling requests of the passengers, who wants to use it. That’s why I have done a comparison between a classical algorithm called Shabbat algorithm and four of my own proposed algorithm, which I have categorized them as modern algorithm to enhance various short coming of classical algorithm like: turnaround time of passengers, capacity of handling more requests in less time etc. For that purpose, I have used Petri Net theory and GPenSIM. I have used them to model and simulate the classical and modern algorithms. For testing and analysis part, I have done sample run of my modern algorithms and made plots out of it, to have a graphical output of them. I have done statistical analysis also which shows turnaround time, ideal travel time, travel time inside car and efficiency of the proposed modern algorithms. According to statistical analysis, First Come First Serve elevator algorithm has less turn around time, less travel time inside car and increased efficiency as compared to Shabbat algorithm.
